Formal Abstract  
This work presents a comprehensive framework for image classification on the CIFAR-10 benchmark. The system integrates a PyTorch-based convolutional neural network (CifarNet) with optimized training protocols including adaptive learning rate scheduling, gradient stabilization, and rigorous regularization. A complementary Tkinter GUI application enables intuitive model deployment with real-time probabilistic visualization. Key innovations include architecture-preserving model serialization, automated checkpoint management, and interactive confidence heatmaps. Empirical results demonstrate robust accuracy (>90%) and subsecond inference latency, establishing a reproducible pipeline for computer vision experimentation and deployment. The codebase emphasizes maintainability through deterministic logging, hardware-agnostic execution, and modular design patterns.
